Branch
- Name: chore/gofmt-certstore-ignore-ds-store

Testing Notes
- Full `go test ./...` is constrained in sandboxed/macOS keychain environments.
- Safe subsets ran successfully: `./fakeca`, `./ietf-cms/timestamp`.
- For local runs, consider exporting: `GODEBUG=x509usefallbackroots=1`.
- The certstore tests interact with the macOS keychain and may require local, unsandboxed execution.

Next Steps
- Monitor PR/CI and merge once green.
- Optionally add Makefile targets: `test-min` (subset) and `test-all` with documented env vars.
- Optionally remove the compiled `smimesign` binary in the repo root if not needed.

Local Workspace
- Untracked caches created for sandboxed testing: `.gocache/`, `.gomodcache/`.
